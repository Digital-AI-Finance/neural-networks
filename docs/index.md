# Neural Networks

**From Brain to Business: How Machines Learn to Predict**

Welcome to this comprehensive course on neural networks. This course takes you from the biological inspiration of neurons through to practical business applications in market prediction.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Explain** how biological neurons inspire artificial neural networks
- **Calculate** the output of an artificial neuron given inputs and weights
- **Design** a simple multilayer network architecture
- **Trace** information flow through forward propagation
- **Describe** how networks learn by minimizing prediction errors
- **Evaluate** when neural networks are appropriate for business problems
