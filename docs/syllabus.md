## Course Information

**Course Title:** Neural Networks - From Brain to Business

**Description:** This course introduces neural networks from biological inspiration through to practical business applications in financial prediction. Students will understand how artificial neurons work, how networks learn, and how to evaluate their performance.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic algebra (variables, equations, functions)
- Basic statistics (mean, probability, standard deviation)
- No programming experience required

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Explain** the biological inspiration for artificial neural networks
2. **Calculate** the output of neurons using weighted sums and activation functions
3. **Design** appropriate network architectures for classification problems
4. **Trace** information flow through forward propagation
5. **Describe** how gradient descent enables learning
6. **Diagnose** training problems (overfitting, underfitting, learning rate issues)
7. **Evaluate** model performance using confusion matrices and backtesting
